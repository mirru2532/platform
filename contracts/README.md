Ok so I put this together quick while my mom made me some tea it's basically just the Convex contracts + data in a package and maybe I'll add some scripts to search through the data but anyways you can use this because Convex didn't publish anything by themselves yet and oh did I say we have a cool logo?

## Installation

```bash
yarn add --dev convex-enjoyer-pack
```
